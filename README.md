# The Self-Taught Computer Scientist (Cory Althoff)
This repository contains my solutions to the Cory Althoff chapter's challenges.

The book is all about algorithms and data structures which are essential to understand for every honest computer scientist.
It was primarily written for people that have not had any serious formal education in the computer science field as they are often missing on the fundaments.

## Opinion
**Mediocre take at an especially important subject.** Reading the book chapter-by-chapter has been very sad.
From the very beginning, it felt like everything the author wanted is to just get this book out as quickly as possible.
Each chapter follows pretty much the same, uninspiring, and boring schema.

The data structures and algorithms are at the core of computer science, thus they are not to be neglected.
They are to be taken seriously and you should find the best sources of knowledge possible. By the best sources, I mean
these that invite you to think about the problem and tinker with it. This book is precisely the opposite.
Here, the implementations are usually given to you within the first pages of each chapter. You do not have
to wrap your head around on how to transform abstract concepts into a code.
